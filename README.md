### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started designing the site from the phone resolution, i.e. 375px, while using a lot of Firefox add-on for developers to get an idea of the box model. The site has only one media query breakpoint, it is set at a resolution of 992px, the page at the 1440px resolution specified in the design displays correctly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Firefox Developer Edition
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Perfect Pixel Chrome Addon

### What I learned

I learned how to create responsive websites, on a mobile first basis, in the process of creating the layout I discovered an add-on for chrome called perfect pixel, it helped me a lot in my work so far, in fact I had to start building the site again from the beginning when I discovered how inaccurately I spaced the elements. I also tried to make the site as accurate and pixel perfect as possible. I improved my flexbox work, learned how to set display flex in the appropriate wrappers. I also learned how to work flex on smaller objects.

### Continued development

I need to work to make my CSS code more readable, to add more comments and use more semantic characters. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I also learn hard from my mistakes.
